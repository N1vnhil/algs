# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms are basically based on 5 basic techniques.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Technique inserts element to the sorted array in each run.

Two insertion sorts are implemnted here: the simple insertion sort, and shell's sort.

Shell's sort takes a larger step each time, and gradually reduce the step, to avoid redundant element comparison in the simple insertion sort.


## Selection Sort

Selection Technique selects out the largest (or smallest element) in each run to reduce the orginal problem.

Two selection sorts are implemented here: the simple selection sort, and heap sort.

Heap sort use heap to optimize the sorting process.


## Compare Sort

Compare Technique compares elements and swap those elements based on the result of comparision.

Two compare sorts are implemented here: bubble sort and quick sort.

Bubble sort is the simple compare sort that compares nearby elements and swap them based on the result.

Quick sort is a compare sort that applies divide and conquer technique, which locates one single element in each run.


## Merge Sort

Merge sort uses divide and conquer technique.

## Radix Sort
